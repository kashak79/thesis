\chapter{Introduction}

Researchers are spending more than half of their total research and development hours on the hunt for information, acccording to the US NSF (National Science Foundation). If we could limit the time necessairy for the search for information, researchers would have more time to spend on their research and development, the main point of focus.

Leading search engines mainly provide keyword-based results in response of a search query. This is both limited in terms of accuracy and efficiency of information comprehension. Researchers still have to bend over backwards in order to find more information about authors, their level of expertise and their connections. A new type of information service is required which is focussed on this problem. It should search the desired information and connect, combine and analyze it in the greater picture of the semantic available information on the internet in order to provide as much value to the user as possible.

% Doelstelling

We want to help in this upcoming research by creating a framework that can retrieve experts for any given subject matter. The end result should allow anyone to query the framework with a set of keywords defining the subject area they want to investigate. The outcome of this query is a list of authors, ranked by decreasing level of expertise defined by the dictated keywords, together with a list of papers, highly touted co-authors and any other information the user might find useful.
