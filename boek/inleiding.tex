\chapter{Introduction}

According to the US NSF (National Science Foundation), researchers are reportedly spending more than half of their total research and development hours hunting for information. Thus, to allow researchers to have more time to spend on research and development itself, it is crucial to reduce time on information gathering. 

Currently, leading search engines only provide a keyword-based matched list as the result of a search query, which is limited in terms of accuracy and efficiency of information comprehension. A new type of information service is required that can find the information desired by the researcher, and then connect, combine and analyze it to provide as much value to the user as possible.

\section{Idea}

We want to create a framework that can retrieve experts for any given subject matter.

We closely watched how researchers collect their information. By focussing on understanding the different steps involved in the algorithm of deciding what publishers and papers are worth reading, we could convert these steps into a computer understandable algorithm. The output of this algorithm is a list of the most important authors for a given field of expertise.
