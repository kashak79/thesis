\chapter{Conclusion and future work}

%Our system only provides a snapshot of the expertise on a given time, it should be better if we could provide an overview in time.

Our framework is pure shit. It does not work, it produces bullocks and it can not be used in production. Locks are just empty methods, so scalability is not provided. The system just crashes, while you are crying in a corner. Get on with your life and give us a 10. Thank you.
